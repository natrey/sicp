This repository contains my solutions to exercises in [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html).

## Usage

To run examples you need a support of Scheme language on your machine. 
On MacOS run

```bash
$ brew install mit-scheme
```

To execute procedures from files run

```bash
scheme < file.scm
```

## Documentation

I have found it convenient to use this [documentation](https://www.scheme.com/tspl3/tspl_1.html#./tspl:h0) to look up for available procedures in Scheme.
