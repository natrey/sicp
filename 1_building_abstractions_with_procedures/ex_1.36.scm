#| Modify `fixed-point` so that it prints the sequence of approximations it generates, 
using the `newline` and `display` primitives shown in exercise 1.22. 
Then find a solution to x^x = 1000 by finding a fixed point of x ‚üº log(1000)/log(x).
(Use Scheme's primitive `log` procedure, which computes natural logarithms.)
Compare the number of steps this takes with and without average damping. 
(Note that you cannot start fixed-point with a guess of 1, as this would cause division by log(1) = 0.)
